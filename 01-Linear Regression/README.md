# Introduction to Simple Linear Regression

In this very simple example, we'll explore how to create a very simple fit line, the classic case of y=mx+b. We'll go carefully through each step, so you can see what type of question a simple fit line can answer. Keep in mind, this case is very simplified and is not the approach we'll take later on, its just here to get you thinking about linear regression in perhaps the same way [Galton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton) did.
